# Netflix clone

A Netflix clone is a replica of the popular streaming platform created using technologies like Tailwind CSS and HTML. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that enables developers to build responsive and customizable user interfaces efficiently. By leveraging the power of Tailwind CSS, developers can create visually appealing and responsive layouts for their Netflix clone. HTML, the standard markup language for web development, provides the structure and content of the web pages. Combining the flexibility of Tailwind CSS with the structure of HTML, developers can create a Netflix clone that emulates the user experience and features of the original platform.
